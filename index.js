// Write a JavaScript function to find the largest element in an array of integers without using any built-in methods like Math.max() or sorting algorithms. Optimize your solution for time complexity.

const array = [3, 7, 12, 8, 5];
const largest = Math.max(...array);
console.log(largest);


//Given an array Arr of size N, print the second largest distinct element from an array. If the second largest element doesn't exist then return -1.
